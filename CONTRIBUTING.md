# Contributing to LettuceDetect

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide will get you up and running.

## Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/KRLabsOrg/LettuceDetect.git
cd LettuceDetect

# Create a virtual environment (Python 3.11+)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

There are also optional dependency groups:

```bash
pip install -e ".[api]"   # FastAPI server and client
pip install -e ".[docs]"  # MkDocs documentation
```

## Code style

We use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for both linting and formatting, with a line length of 100.

```bash
# Check formatting
ruff format --check lettucedetect/ lettucedetect_api/ tests/

# Auto-format
ruff format lettucedetect/ lettucedetect_api/ tests/

# Lint
ruff check lettucedetect/ lettucedetect_api/ tests/

# Lint with auto-fix
ruff check --fix lettucedetect/ lettucedetect_api/ tests/
```

Key conventions:
- Use modern type hints (`list[str]`, `dict[str, Any]`, `str | None`) with `from __future__ import annotations`
- Add docstrings to public classes and methods (Sphinx `:param:` / `:return:` style)
- Use `logging` instead of `print()` for runtime messages
- Use `pathlib.Path` instead of `os.path`

## Running tests

```bash
# Run the complete network-free unit suite
python -m pytest
```

Test files must follow the naming pattern `test_*_pytest.py`.

## Project structure

```

  detectors/        # Detection methods (transformer, LLM, RAGFactChecker)
    transformer.py   # Fine-tuned encoder model detector
    llm.py           # OpenAI API-based detector
    factory.py       # make_detector() factory function
    base.py          # Abstract base class
    prompt_utils.py  # Prompt formatting utilities

```

## Making changes

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```

2. **Make your changes.** Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR.

3. **Run lint and tests** before committing:
   ```bash
   ruff format lettucedetect/ lettucedetect_api/ tests/
   ruff check lettucedetect/ lettucedetect_api/ tests/
   python -m pytest
   ```

4. **Open a pull request** against `main`. CI will run lint and tests automatically.

## What to work on

Good areas for contribution:

- **New language support** — add prompt templates in `lettucedetect/prompts/` (see existing `qa_prompt_en.txt` and `summary_prompt_en.txt` as examples, and add the language to `LANG_TO_PASSAGE` in `prompt_utils.py`)
- **New detection methods** — implement `BaseDetector` in `lettucedetect/detectors/` and register it in `factory.py`
- **Documentation** — improve or expand the docs in `docs/`
- **Tests** — increase coverage, especially for edge cases
- **Bug fixes** — check [open issues](https://github.com/KRLabsOrg/LettuceDetect/issues)

### Issue labels

The maintainers use labels to make contribution scope clearer:

- `good first issue` marks small, well-scoped tasks that are suitable for new contributors.
- `help wanted` marks issues where outside implementation or investigation would be useful.
- `bug` marks reproducible behavior that differs from the expected result.
- `documentation` marks docs, examples, templates, and onboarding improvements.

Before starting work, read the issue thread to confirm nobody has already claimed it. If the issue is unclear, ask a focused question before opening a PR.

## Building docs locally

```bash
pip install -e ".[docs]"
mkdocs serve
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.

## Contribution rights

By submitting a pull request you confirm that you wrote the contribution (or
have the right to submit it) and that it may be distributed under this
repository's MIT license (this is the checkbox in the PR template, enforced
by CI). Optionally you can also sign off commits with `git commit -s`
