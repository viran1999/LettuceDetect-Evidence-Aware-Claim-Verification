"""Prompt + output contract for the fine-tuned generative span detectors.

These models (e.g. ``lettucedect-v2-qwen``) were supervised-fine-tuned to answer a
SPECIFIC prompt and emit a ``hallucinated_spans`` JSON object. The wording here is
therefore FROZEN — it must match the training prompt verbatim, or the model
degrades. It intentionally differs from the judge prompt in
``lettucedetect/prompts/hallucination_detection.txt`` (few-shot, ``hallucination_list``)
and from the label *definitions* in :mod:`lettucedetect.datasets.taxonomy` (which are
for data construction / the LLM judge, not this model).

Used by :class:`lettucedetect.detectors.llm.LLMDetector` in its native (trained-model)
mode; see ``LLMDetector(native=True)``.
