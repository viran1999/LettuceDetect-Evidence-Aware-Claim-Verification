"""Single source of truth for the hallucination taxonomy + detection prompt.

Shared by the generative SFT prompt (build_generative_sft), the zero-shot LLM
baseline + our-model eval (evaluate_generative_model imports those), and the
taxonomy head (train_taxonomy_head), so the label set, descriptions, and task
definition never drift across systems.

Descriptions are DATA-AGNOSTIC — they apply to prose, code, tool output, and
structured documents alike (no domain-specific wording). The taxonomy itself is
the definition of what counts as a hallucination: a span the context does not
support falls into exactly one category (and subcategory).
