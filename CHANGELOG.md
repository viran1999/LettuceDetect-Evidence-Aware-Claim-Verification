# Changelog

All notable changes to LettuceDetect are documented here.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-08-14

### Added
- `lettucedetect` command-line entry point: file/stdin/literal inputs, spans or tokens JSON output, transformer and LLM methods (#47, thanks @SemTiOne)
- Detector latency/throughput benchmark script with context-length sweep and peak-memory reporting (#58, thanks @sanmaxdev)
- Claude Code integration: a Stop hook that checks agent answers against grounding context and feeds flagged spans back to the agent; API, in-process, and generative (vLLM) modes (#50)
- Custom zero-shot taxonomies: `include_taxonomy` accepts `{name: description}` label sets on the taxonomy-head cascade and the native generative detector; labels enter as text, so unseen labels type from their description (#92)
- Typed spans in the Streamlit demo: model selector, per-category colors, span table (#57, thanks @w3lld1)

### Fixed
- `LLMDetector` honors `output_format="tokens"` across all three predict entry points (#65, thanks @mobinert)
- Corrected published model ids in the CLI help and docs; the multilingual EuroBERT models are documented as one checkpoint per language with the `transformers<5` note (#33)
- `zero_shot`, `fewshot_path`, and `prompt_path` now raise on native generative detectors instead of being silently ignored (#92)

### Documentation
- Public roadmap (`PUBLIC_ROADMAP.md`) with milestone-linked Now/Next/Exploring sections
- `min_confidence` edge cases documented (#64, thanks @vku2018)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed
- `method="llm"` crashed with `AttributeError: '_validate_min_confidence'` on every `predict` call — `LLMDetector` now subclasses `BaseDetector` like the other detectors, with a hierarchy regression test (#68)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- `min_confidence` threshold on `predict` / `predict_prompt` / `predict_prompt_batch` — drops spans below the given confidence, `0.0` (default) keeps everything (#62, thanks @Aditya20029)
- Contributor infrastructure: issue forms with native GitHub issue types, PR template with contribution-rights attestation (CI-enforced), Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (#61, thanks @sanmaxdev)

### Fixed
- `HallucinationSample.from_json` no longer requires `dataset` and `language` fields (#54)
- PyPI artifacts now ship only package code and prompt data

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **Code, tool-output and agentic-workflow hallucination detection** — a new family of v2 detectors trained on a unified span-level benchmark spanning SWE-bench coding-agent traces, developer tool output and structured documents (ACL / README / Wikipedia), alongside RAGTruth and 14-language PsiloQA:
  - `lettucedect-v2-qwen-2b` — generative detector that emits **typed** hallucination spans (category + subcategory) in a single pass, with optional reasoning
  - `lettucedect-v2-mmbert-base` — fast encoder detector (binary token-level spans)
  - `lettucedect-v2-taxonomy-head` — label-conditioned typing head that types encoder spans without a generative model
- **Typed encoder cascade** — `TransformerDetector(taxonomy_head=...)` attaches a `category`/`subcategory` to each binary span via the taxonomy head (`HallucinationDetector(method="transformer", model_path=..., taxonomy_head=...)`)
- **Native generative-detector support in `LLMDetector`** — auto-detects the v2 generative models and routes them to their detection prompt with structured typed-span output
- Automatic context chunking for long inputs — when context exceeds `max_length`, passages are split into groups and scored independently with `max()` aggregation
- Hungarian language support (prompts and summary templates)
- GitHub Pages documentation site with KR Labs branding
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` for new contributors

### Fixed
- `answer_start_token` bug in `prepare_tokenized_input` — previously computed from context side, which gave wrong results when context was truncated; now computed from answer side
- `predict_prompt()` now warns when input exceeds `max_length` instead of silently truncating

### Changed
- CI lint job runs standalone (only needs ruff, no heavy deps)
- Modernized type hints across codebase (`list[str]` instead of `List[str]`)
- Replaced `print()` with `logging` in LLM detector
- Cleaned up duplicate test fixtures

## [0.1.8] - 2025-08-31

### Added
- RAGFactChecker integration for triplet-based hallucination detection
- Hallucination generation pipeline for synthetic training data
- LangChain integration (callbacks, chains, tools)
- Elysia framework integration
- TinyLettuce — smaller distilled model variants
- MkDocs documentation site
- Batch processing support for RAGFactChecker

## [0.1.7] - 2025-05-15

### Added
- Web API with FastAPI and async Python client (`lettucedetect_api/`)
- LLM-based hallucination detection using OpenAI API
- Multilingual support (German, French, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Chinese)
- RAGBench dataset preprocessing and training
- EuroBERT model support (8K context window)
- AUROC evaluation metric
- Caching for LLM API calls

### Changed
- Restructured detectors into factory pattern (`make_detector()`)
- Added seed to training for reproducibility

### Fixed
- Tensor copying bug in inference
- Encoder SEP token handling

## [0.1.6] - 2025-02-27
