"""Reusable orchestration for dataset generation.

Centralizes the batched, resumable, failure-logging generation loop that the
code-hallucination pipeline previously implemented inline. Every source adapter
uses this so the proven behavior — async batching against local vLLM, skipping
already-done items on restart, incremental flush, and failure logging for later
replay — is written once and never re-dropped.

The per-item work is supplied as an async callable ``process(item) -> Outcome``;
the runner handles batching, resumability, and I/O.
